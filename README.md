I am a student web developer current studying JavaScript and Angular.  I have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and some Ruby experience.  Angular is what I'm learning now, and I am very excited about it.  I hope to become a web developer some day and am looking forward to meeting new people, learning to code, and how to advance my skills.
